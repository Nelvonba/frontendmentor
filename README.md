4 -  My process:

	a) I first established the HTML blocks by importing the image and the fonts. 
	b) Then created the class .core and .backqr to manipulate them in my CSS file. 
	c) Then, I started the responsive part of my code.

5 - Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


6 - What I learned

	Mostly, I learned how to use grid and flexbox with with their respective syntaxe. 
	Exemple :
.core {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  padding-top: 100px;

  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;



7 - Continued development

 	In future projects. I want to have a better flow coding in CSS and especially and especially with nice and responsive visuals using Grid and Flexbox.
	I also know that a better padding and margin 'flow to write' is a point I want to improve.
